# Project overview

We want a genuine, functioning job board.

Applications need the ability to upload related files -> Need a section to add questions such as work and school which goes back to file upload

Jobs need to be posted with salaries, desired skills

Well file upload, Chat GPT parsing, and Resume Content displayed in relevant sections on front end 
-> Need to understand how I am going to store this on the backend
-> Also probably going to not save the physical resume... unless I want to save it for future applications? Like easy apply

Need to present this data on the company side for each applicant
-> Users should be able to customize an application for each job they apply to
-> Is there a way to store only the changes to a base set and not store an entire duplicate copy? (Research Diff Merge)
